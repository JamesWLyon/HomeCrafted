                <p>
                    At HomeCrafted, our mission is to make home décor more accessible, inspiring, and human. We believe that 
                    great design should be something anyone can explore, learn from, and feel confident pursuing—whether that 
                    means browsing ideas, understanding styles, or imagining what’s possible within their own space.
                    <br><br>
                    We are committed to empowering skilled designers and decorators by giving them a platform to showcase 
                    their work authentically. By highlighting real projects and real craftsmanship, HomeCrafted helps 
                    professionals build trust, grow their presence, and connect with homeowners who value quality, creativity, 
                    and experience.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, HomeCrafted exists to bridge inspiration and action. We aim to turn ideas into outcomes by 
                    making it easy to move from discovery to collaboration, ensuring every home has the opportunity to reflect 
                    the people who live in it—beautifully and thoughtfully.

                    <span class="sub-title">The Journey</span>
                    HomeCrafted started in 2025 in a teenager’s bedroom with a simple idea and a lot of experimenting. 
                    After spending hours browsing home décor photos online, it became clear that inspiration was easy to find, 
                    but the people behind the work were not. Beautiful spaces were everywhere, yet there was no easy way to 
                    learn from them or connect with the designers who created them.
                    <br><br>
                    What began as a small personal project slowly took shape through trial, redesigns, and late nights 
                    refining how projects should be displayed. The focus was always on showcasing real work in a clean, 
                    honest way—letting projects speak for themselves while keeping the professionals who made them visible 
                    and accessible.
                    <br><br>
                    Today, HomeCrafted continues to grow with that same mindset. It remains a place built around real 
                    projects, real creativity, and real connections, helping people move naturally from discovering ideas 
                    to working with experienced designers when they’re ready.
