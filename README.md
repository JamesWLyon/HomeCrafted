# HomeCrafted

## About The Project

HomeCrafted is a personal web project I am currently working on that blends ideas from platforms like Fiverr and Pinterest, but focuses specifically on home décor and design. The goal of the project is to create a space where inspiration and services come together, allowing users to browse real home décor projects while also discovering the professionals behind the work.

On HomeCrafted, creators and designers can post photos of projects they have completed, include descriptions of their work, and list what they would charge to create something similar for others. At the same time, users looking for inspiration can explore ideas, learn more about different styles, and choose to connect with experienced designers if they want help bringing their vision to life.

This project is being built as a way to improve my front-end development skills while also experimenting with layout design, image-focused interfaces, and user-friendly navigation. HomeCrafted is an ongoing work in progress and will continue to evolve with new features and improvements.
